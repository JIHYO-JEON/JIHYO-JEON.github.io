# Big-O Notation

Time complexity indicates how many steps must be taken to perform a certain algorithm.  

Considering the best case and worst case of time complexity, the best case is not that significant. This is because situations where the best case occurs when performing algorithms are practically rare. The average case can also be considered, but it does not provide meaningful information about the worst case scenario. Therefore, when comparing performance between algorithms, it is helpful to compare worst-case which is upper bound of time complexity.

The number of operations required to perform the algorithm which is time complexity informs us about "the number of elements that need to be processed, how much the algorithm will grow in size as the number of data increases."  
  
> SO, In computer science, time complexity is a way of expressing the time it takes to run an algorithm. Time-complexity typically counts how many times the basic actions performed by algorithms, and estimates that each basic action takes a certain amount of time. It is not the measurement of 'Time', but 'time increment in accordance with a number of inputs'. The size of input is assumed to be very big.


** Big-O Notation is a method of expressing the complexity associated with the number of elements that an algorithm will address. **
