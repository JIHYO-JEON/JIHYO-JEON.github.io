# Very stupid computer

In fact, computers are a kind of calculator. Computers can do math operations very quickly. So we use computers when we need the functions of a calculator, such as getting the sum of numbers, calculating taxes, or processing numerical data.
Watching videos and listening to music through a computer or smartphone also feels like a math operation to a computer. All the data is made up of numbers, so what computers do is only speeding up the four-pronged operations we've learned. However, speeding up the four-pronged operation does not mean that computers have intelligence.

# Having intelligence?
