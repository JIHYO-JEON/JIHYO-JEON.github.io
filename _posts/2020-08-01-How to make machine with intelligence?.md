# How to make machine with intelligence?

Human has always been trying to understand how our brain works, and make machines to act like our brain. It means we have been trying to make machines which can **think**.
It was not easy like making machines that can do simple things like calculating or lifting heavy stuff. It was not enough to fulfill human's will. What we need are a machine that can classify images, recognize weird cells between healthy cells, or play chess or Go with us! Of course, it is not easy. It is not making machines anymore, it is more like mimicking how human thinks.

# Got some idea from nature!

Understanding human brain with math did not help it. Think, is it possible to build living creature's biology with only logical math of 0 and 1?
**However, one day,** one good idea came out. It was just cloning human brain like neurons not designing digital circuits. Also, there was a huge development of computer hardware like GPU. GPU has more simple workers than CPU so it was perfect to do simple calculations what we need in **neural networks**, computer method works like neurons!

# Examples of Neural Networks

As Korean, the biggest event in last decade about AI was ofc, the great Google Deepmind Challenge match, the Go match held in 2016 between AlphaGo and Sedol Lee for 5 days. The match between the best Go artificial intelligence program and the best human talent in Go attracted attention, and the final result was AlphaGo's victory over Sedol Lee with four wins and one loss. This incident imprinted the concept of artificial intelligence on Koreans.
Artificial intelligence can be easily found in our lives. Artificial intelligence is also used to determine whether Netflix's recommendation system, Google's automatic completion function, Apple Watch users are exercising or not, and whether smartphones will catch Wi-Fi or use a communication network.
And the basic of all artificial intelligence is **neural networks**.

# How Neural Networks Work?

So from now on, I am gonna post about neural networks. How it works, what can it does, etc. This is the start of machine learning and deep learning!
