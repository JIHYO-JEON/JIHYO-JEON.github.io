# Very stupid computer

In fact, computers are a kind of calculator. Computers can do math operations very quickly. So we use computers when we need the functions of a calculator, such as getting the sum of numbers, calculating taxes, or processing numerical data.
Watching videos and listening to music through a computer or smartphone also feels like a math operation to a computer. All the data is made up of numbers, so what computers do is only speeding up the four-pronged operations we've learned. However, speeding up the four-pronged operation does not mean that computers have intelligence.

# Having intelligence?
Then how can we say what having intelligence is? Let us think about the photo below.

Can you recognize what is it in the photo? Actually, you don't need to think. It is a cat. We, human being, can say it with confidence and it is even hard to get it wrong.

What about this photo? What is it about? How many dogs in this photo? There are clearly 2 dogs in the photo.

Like this, we humans can process a large amount of information that an image has and identify the objects that are not there. However, it is not easy for computers. Actually, it is very hard.

| Tasks | Computer | Human | 
|--|--|--|
| Calculating a lot of numbers | easy | takes long |
| Understanding images | hard | easy |

The point is, human wants computers do works instead of us, not only just calculating numbers, but also understanding images. Because computer can work faster and longer than human.

And the thing that makes computer can do these hard tasks is **artificial intelligence**. Because computer is consists of electronic circuits, it is finding and making new algorithms to solve hard problems for machine. Make machines do things like human.
