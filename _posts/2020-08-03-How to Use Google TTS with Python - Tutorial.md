## Google TTS
### 1. First sign up for Google Cloud Platform
[Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com/?hl=ko)
First, you need to add a new project Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
Then, download the json Auth key named like 'yourname-text-to-speech-0a0a000aa00a' with first 10 digits of your private key id.


### 2. Create Python project and place your json file in it
The environment needs your google application credentials, so it doesn't need to place in the same place with your code but make sure the address of the json file.

### 3. Environment Setting

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	import os  
	import time  
	import html  
	from google.cloud import texttospeech
{% endhighlight %}

If you use the conda environment for setting, install Google Cloud Sdk with the line below,
		`conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-sdk`
And set the google application credentials.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "./your_json_file"
{% endhighlight %}

And find the voice you want, with the function below,

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	def list_voices():  
	    """Lists the available voices."""  
	  client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()  
	    # Performs the list voices request  
	  voices = client.list_voices()  
	    for voice in voices.voices:  
	        # Display the voice's name. Example: tpc-vocoded  
	  print(f"Name: {voice.name}")  
	        # Display the supported language codes for this voice. Example: "en-US"  
	  for language_code in voice.language_codes:  
	            print(f"Supported language: {language_code}")  
	        ssml_gender = texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender(voice.ssml_gender)  
	        # Display the SSML Voice Gender  
	  print(f"SSML Voice Gender: {ssml_gender.name}")  
	        # Display the natural sample rate hertz for this voice. Example: 24000  
	  print(f"Natural Sample Rate Hertz: {voice.natural_sample_rate_hertz}\n")
{% endhighlight %}

Here is the sample video of voices that you can see in the voice list. I picked "en-US-Standard-C" which is charismatic female voice.

[Voice Samples Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9b7pNTE_SY)

	Name: en-GB-Wavenet-A  
	Supported language: en-GB  
	SSML Voice Gender: FEMALE  
	Natural Sample Rate Hertz: 24000  
	 
	Name: en-GB-Wavenet-B  
	Supported language: en-GB  
	SSML Voice Gender: MALE  
	Natural Sample Rate Hertz: 24000  
	 
	Name: en-GB-Wavenet-C  
	Supported language: en-GB  
	SSML Voice Gender: FEMALE  
	Natural Sample Rate Hertz: 24000  
	 
	Name: en-GB-Wavenet-D  
	Supported language: en-GB  
	SSML Voice Gender: MALE  
	Natural Sample Rate Hertz: 24000  
	 
	.
	.
	.

### 4. Create TTS voice file

The easiest way is just creating the 'mp3' or 'wav' file with the function below. There is no extra options in the way TTS reads.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	def text_to_speech(voice_name, text, filename):  
	    language_code = "-".join(voice_name.split("-")[:2])  
	    text_input = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=text)  
	    voice_params = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(  
	        language_code=language_code, name=voice_name  
	    )  
	    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(  
	        audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16  
	    )  
	    client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()  
	    response = client.synthesize_speech(  
	        input=text_input, voice=voice_params, audio_config=audio_config  
	    )  
	    filename = f"{filename}.wav"
	  with open(filename, "wb") as out:  
	        out.write(response.audio_content)  
	        print(f'Audio content written to "{filename}"'
{% endhighlight %}

Fill three inputs of this function (voice_name, text, filename) and run it. Then you can see the wav file named 'VoiceFiles.wav'.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	voice = "en-US-Standard-C"
	Text = "His hope is based on the fact that he is a researcher for a company that has invented a revolutionary new technology. The refrigerator is an example of the type of devices that use this new technology. The refrigerator is not powered by electricity, but rather, it uses a special chemical to cool down."
	text_to_speech(voice, Text, "VoiceFiles")
{% endhighlight %}

 If you want to change the file extension, fix the line,
 
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
	filename = f"{filename}.wav"
{% endhighlight %}

in the text_to_speech function definition.
